Most of the accident nowadays happens because the driver behind the wheel have caught to the long tiring working schedule and dozed off without knowing and their senses are not alert. They will now driving at speeds with 
minimum conscience. This can lead to fatal cirumstances and even to death. This project aim to nullify this by accurately predicting whether the driver is alert and if not alerting him/her of the same and warning them 
rest somewhere nearby.
This project uses haar cascade frontal face algorithm for face detection and haar cascade eye for eye contour detection and maintains the blink ratio of the eye if the eye is closed for more than an specific amount of time
more than what an normal blink duration. It beeps to alert the driver.
